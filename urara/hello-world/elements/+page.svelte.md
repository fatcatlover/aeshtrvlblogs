### Cameron Highlands 

## Day 1:
We arrived at Cameron Highlands at around 10:00am, feeling excited and ready for a fun adventure. Our first stop was at BOH Tea Centre in Brinchang (Jalan Gunung Brinchang, 39000 Brinchang, Pahang, Malaysia) where we enjoyed a beautiful view at 10:27am. After taking some pictures, my father drove us to our hotel, Nova Highland's (Jalan Aranda Nova, Greencow, 39100, 2, 59, Brinchang, 39000 Tanah Rata, Pahang), for check-in from 1:42pm - 2:01pm. The hotel was located in a very good spot, near to all the must-visit places and had a shopping center beneath it with good food options that we couldn't resist, the place is rated 4.3 stars on Google Maps. Then, my father drove us to Pasar Pagi Kea Farm (59, Brinchang, 39000 Tanah Rata, Pahang) where we arrived at 6:14pm. After that, we went to Cameron Centrum (Cameron Centrum, 39000 Brinchang, Pahang, Malaysia) and visited Billion Shopping Center and FamilyMart Cameron Centrum which was located in it, the place is rated 4.3 stars on Google Maps. After a long day of exploring, we finally arrived back at the hotel.

# Day 2:
Unfortunately, we found out that Queen Elizabeth had passed away while we were at Cameron Highlands. For breakfast, we went to a restaurant beside our hotel and then my father drove us to 200 Seeds Cafe (NO 27, KAMPUNG TAMAN SEDIA, Tanah Rata, 39000 Tanah Rata, Pahang) for lunch, which took us 3 hours to get there from 9:43am - 1:41pm, the place is rated 3.9 stars on Google Maps. Finally, we arrived and the food was interesting. There was a sambal strawberry which is very unusual because it's not a usual jam. We spent around RM50 per person on lunch. After that, we went to Pasar Pagi Kea Farm (59, Brinchang, 39000 Tanah Rata, Pahang) again at 5:20pm and returned back to the hotel, arriving at 7:28pm.

# Day 3:
We had breakfast at 7 Strawberry Farm (156, 59, Tringkap, 39000 Tanah Rata, Pahang) and tried to pick strawberries for ourselves. However, all the strawberries had already been picked by other tourists by the time we got there at 11:07am. We were a bit disappointed but still enjoyed our breakfast and the beautiful view. The place is rated 4.0 stars on Google Maps.

Overall, our trip to Cameron Highlands was a great experience. I would highly recommend the places we visited and would give them 4-5-star ratings on Google Maps. The BOH Tea Centre, 200 Seeds Cafe, and Pasar Pagi Kea Farm are definitely a must-visit. If you're planning to go, don't forget to try the sambal strawberry and bring extra cash for souvenirs and food! Hope this helps!
