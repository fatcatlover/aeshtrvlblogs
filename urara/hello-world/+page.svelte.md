### Trip to Penang

##  Penang, also known as the Pearl of the Orient, is a beautiful Malaysian island that attracts visitors from all over the world. I recently had the opportunity to visit Penang, and it was a trip I will never forget. From the delicious food to the beautiful street art, Penang is a place that has something for everyone.

On the first day of my trip, I checked in at the Travelodge Georgetown hotel, located at 505 Jalan Bukit Mertajam, George Town, 10300 George Town, Penang. The hotel is rated 4.1 stars on Google maps and is a great option for budget travelers. After checking in, I drove to Hameediyah Restaurant, located at 164A Campbell St, George Town, 10100 George Town, Penang. The restaurant is very popular and is known for its delicious nasi kandar. Although there was a long queue, the food was definitely worth the wait.

After lunch, I headed back to my hotel for some rest before taking a Grab ride (a popular ride-sharing app in Southeast Asia) to GANI famous pasembur, located at 136 Jalan Penang, George Town, 10000 George Town, Penang. The restaurant is rated 4.4 stars on Google maps and is famous for its pasembur, a Malaysian salad with fried dough fritters and seafood. The pasembur was indeed tasty and worth the visit.

On the second day of my trip, I left the Travelodge Georgetown hotel at 9:19am for breakfast at Roti Canai Transfer Road, located at Jalan Transfer, George Town, 10050 George Town, Penang. However, I was disappointed with the quality of the food, which did not pass the hygiene check. Therefore, I would not recommend this place to others. After breakfast, I walked to Chowrasta Market, located at Jalan Penang, George Town, 10000 George Town, Penang. The market is a popular destination for locals and tourists alike, with vendors selling everything from fresh produce to souvenirs.

While wandering around the market, I came across a beautiful street art named Boy on Chair, located at 141 Jalan Penang, George Town, 10000 George Town, Penang. The street art is just one of many that can be found in the city, and it's definitely worth taking the time to explore the streets and alleys to discover them.

After the market, My father drove us to Pak Mid Cafe, located at 10 Lorong Mahsuri 2, Bayan Baru, 11950 Bayan Lepas, Penang, arriving at 4:20pm. The cafe is rated 4.2 stars on Google maps and is known for its delicious nasi lemak. From there, I drove to Pasar Malam Batu Ferringhi, a night market located at Jalan Batu Ferringhi, Batu Ferringhi, 11100 Batu Ferringhi, Penang. The market is a great place to shop for souvenirs and try out local food.

After the night market, I headed back to the Travelodge Georgetown hotel for some rest before going out to eat at GANI famous pasembur again at 8:44pm. After dinner, I took a stroll around Padang Kota Lama (Esplanade), located at Lebuh Light, George Town, 10200 George Town, Penang. The area is a popular spot for locals and tourists to gather and enjoy the beautiful sea view. During my visit, I also saw many mascots like minions and spiderman.

On the third and final day of my trip, I had breakfast at Hutton Lane and then proceed to my next destination, Kuala Kangsar.

I hope this blog has given you some inspiration for your next trip to Penang. With its unique blend of culture, cuisine, and history, this vibrant city has something for everyone.
